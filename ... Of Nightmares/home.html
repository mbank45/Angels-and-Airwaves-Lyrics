"Home"<br>
<br>
There's a wind that contains the night<br>
A fellow shadow wanders free<br>
It runs across a sandy floor<br>
With crooked jags and even seams<br>
<br>
The moon's risen high above<br>
The clouds can make them heavenly<br>
A drought was kicked out of the class by<br>
Frozen rings and dirty streams<br>
<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
<br>
The neighbours drink and toast the pain<br>
To fill up holes they may have made<br>
A child plays a silly game<br>
With toys that he's imagining<br>
<br>
The world is a deadly place<br>
That swallows us with crass and ease<br>
The only thing left from your name is<br>
A tragic love of poetry<br>
<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
I'm Home<br>
<br>
Someday you'll come back<br>
You'll come back<br>
You'll come wake us<br>
<br>
Someday you'll come back<br>
You'll come back<br>
You'll come wake us<br>
<br>
Someday you'll come back<br>
You'll come back<br>
You'll come wake us<br>
<br>
Someday you'll come back<br>
You'll come back<br>
You'll come wake us
