"In to The Night"<br>
<br>
I wanna know<br>
At night I'll walk the streets to lead where any other dream can rarely go, you know<br>
I'm paralyzed<br>
Holding up a crying child I rarely ever fall asleep with time, a lie.<br>
<br>
Breath it in, just follow me right to the end<br>
When the sky goes you are the first to fall in<br>
If you follow I'll give you the end of a rope<br>
When the night goes carry you to the unknown,<br>
Into the night we will go.<br>
<br>
I don't wanna feel<br>
That same old shitty wasted day I always ever feel when I am ill<br>
These sterile eyes<br>
Seen every little crack and watch those pieces fall from high up in the sky.<br>
<br>
Breath it in, just follow me right to the end<br>
When the sky goes you are the first to fall in<br>
If you follow I'll give you the end of a rope<br>
When the night goes carry you to the unknown,<br>
Into the night we will go.<br>
