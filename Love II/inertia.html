"Inertia"<br>
<br>
You’re a liar. <br>
You wear a gun, makes you look bigger. <br>
You scare the crowd, don’t you feel smarter? <br>
Like a little kid, you play with fire. <br>
You do your part, you do it all. <br>
<br>
But those words from your mouth they are scary, <br>
and the hate that you have, that you carry, <br>
it will grow, it will grow, till we’re buried. <br>
<br>
You're so clever.<br>
If this is war, it's like no other.<br>
If there is blame it's on each other.<br>
I hear the cry, they last forever.<br>
We did our part, we came along. <br>
<br>
But those words from your mouth they are scary,<br>
and the hate that you have, that you carry,<br>
it will grow, it will grow, till we're buried. <br>
And there will be nothing left except sadness,<br>
and a scar without words, without anything<br>
cus we've done this before, this is madness. <br>
<br>
I am sorry, but those words from your mouth they are scary,<br>
and the hate that you have, that you carry,<br>
it will grow, it will grow till we're buried. <br>
And there will be nothing left except sadness, <br>
and a scar without words, without anything,<br>
cus we've done this before,<br>
this is madness, this is wrong, this is us, this is happening,<br>
but we've done this before,<br>
but we're standing, we're still standing, and we've done this before,<br>
but we're standing, we're still standing, and we've done this before,<br>
but we're standing.<br>
<br>
[speaking]<br>
You got to remember the good things, and cherish the memories and go on with life cus it don't stop.<br> You only have to remember that what you've done in your life may change what someone else is doing in their life.<br> And it changes everything. It's so amazing, love!
