"All That We Are"<br>
<br>
The ice is really cold, the street lights really old<br>
Her child's all alone, as she melts into her own<br>
And slowly fades away, into a river full of shame<br>
But at least numb to the pain, can you see it?<br>
<br>
Can you feel the shallow wave, from a needle to the grave<br>
From our hell too far away, you're my only<br>
You're so sad my valentine, on your journey to the light<br>
But first straight to the fire<br>
<br>
And we are<br>
All that we are<br>
Holding on until we fall apart<br>
And we are<br>
All that we are<br>
Holding on until we fall apart<br>
And we are<br>
All that we are<br>
Holding on until we fall apart<br>
And we are<br>
All that we are<br>
Holding on until we fall apart<br>
And we are<br>
<br>
All that we are, All that we are<br>
All that we are, All That we are<br>
All That we are, All That we are<br>
All that we are, All that we are
