"One Last Thing"<br>
<br>
Chalked up in a city street<br>
Broke glass in bloody scene<br>
Young guns that are half my age<br>
Baghdad up to Monterrey<br>
Cell phones and the magazines<br>
Death bombs and the human beings<br>
Hate war and diamond rings<br>
Nightmares of silly things<br>
How does anybody sleep at night?<br>
Out of mind but not out of sight<br>
Out of love and we just begun<br>
Livin large in America<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
But I found, one last thing<br>
To believe in<br>
But I found, one last thing<br>
To believe in<br>
<br>
Close calls and we're holdin on<br>
Police lines and fire alarms<br>
High winds with a heavy fall<br>
Dead birds in a parking stall<br>
How does anybody sleep at night?<br>
I lay in bed and I close my eyes<br>
I kind of rest but it starts to hurt<br>
Living here is a lot of work<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
But I found, one last thing<br>
To believe in<br>
But I found, one last thing<br>
To believe in<br>
But I found<br>
<br>
[Transmission:]<br>
(Why we's true to breathe in the most righteous breath)<br>
(A feeling of heartfelt purpose, and a sense of hope)<br>
But I found<br>
One last thing<br>
(For something bigger than ourselves)<br>
<br>
[Chorus: x2]<br>
But I found, one last thing<br>
To believe in<br>
But I found, one last thing<br>
To believe in<br>
<br>
To believe in
