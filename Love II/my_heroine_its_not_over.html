"My Heroine (It's Not Over)"<br>
(Crawl)<br>
<br>
I made tonight a memory<br>
I can walk for miles and miles<br>
I left a shadow at her feet<br>
I can see her all alone<br>
The night itself a reverie<br>
I can dream this out for a while<br>
I keep her lost in lock and key<br>
Cause she's just my kind of style<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
She takes my hand and leads me in<br>
It is not over<br>
She sets the mood and so I begin<br>
And I walk over<br>
She speaks the word to make me grin<br>
Can I please have her?<br>
We grab a hold to brace the end<br>
This is where I am speaking of<br>
<br>
I made tonight a memory<br>
Yea you took me higher and higher<br>
You make it hard for me to leave<br>
But I'm coming back to you<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
She takes my hand and leads me in<br>
It is not over<br>
She sets the mood and so I begin<br>
And I walk over<br>
She speaks the word to make me grin<br>
Can I please have her?<br>
We grab a hold to brace the end<br>
This is where I am speaking of<br>
<br>
I crawl my way<br>
Back in your head<br>
To hear you speak<br>
And dream again<br>
To touch your lips<br>
From deep within<br>
A bit like love and heroin<br>
I cross the grave<br>
Invite the bends<br>
Carry you out<br>
When the world ends<br>
Across the wave<br>
It lures you in<br>
You're in my arms<br>
Just like the wind<br>
<br>
It's not over, over, over<br>
It's not over, over, over<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
She takes my hand and leads me in<br>
It is not over<br>
She sets the mood and so I begin<br>
And I walk over<br>
She speaks the word to make me grin<br>
Can I please have her?<br>
We grab a hold to brace the end<br>
This is where I am speaking of<br>
<br>
[x2:]<br>
I crawl my way<br>
Back in your end<br>
To hear you speak<br>
And dream again<br>
To touch your lips<br>
From deep within<br>
A bit like love and heroin<br>
I cross the grave<br>
Invite the bends<br>
Carry you out<br>
When the world ends<br>
Across the wave<br>
It lures you in<br>
You're in my arms<br>
Just like the wind<br>
<br>
[x4 in Background:]<br>
It's not over, over, over, over
