"Moon As My Witness"<br>
<br>
There's something you said<br>
A whirlwind, a voice<br>
"Together," you said<br>
But I have no choice<br>
Oh please<br>
Stay a while<br>
God, I love your smile<br>
<br>
I never felt alone<br>
But here feels like hell<br>
When I am on my own<br>
And you're all I feel<br>
Oh please<br>
Stay a while<br>
God, I love your smile<br>
<br>
A rat in a cage<br>
A stone in a stream<br>
I float far away<br>
I live in a dream<br>
Oh please<br>
Stay a while<br>
God, I love your smile<br>
<br>
And how bout that thing<br>
You do when you're awake<br>
A laugh with a sting<br>
A bite from a snake<br>
Oh please<br>
Stay a while<br>
God, I love your smile.
