"Behold A Pale Horse"<br>
<br>
And when the time is right<br>
It's gonna change the world<br>
And with the darken sky<br>
There is nothing thru<br>
And there is no more love<br>
Or fucking gates of pearl<br>
<br>
I see the seven stars<br>
I see the seven stands<br>
I hear the deathly voice<br>
I count the sense we have<br>
I am the living one<br>
I am the first and last<br>
<br>
The crowds<br>
The noise<br>
The change of the guard<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
Kids, they laugh<br>
As fire it eats up the world<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
<br>
And they know who we are<br>
The seven angels sing<br>
And several billion die<br>
With the Earth shaking<br>
Yeah they know who we are<br>
And they will set us free<br>
<br>
The crowds<br>
The noise<br>
The change of the guard<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
Kids, they laugh<br>
This fire it eats up the world<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
<br>
The crowds<br>
The noise<br>
The change of the guard<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
Kids, they laugh<br>
This fire it eats up the world<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
<br>
The crowds<br>
The noise<br>
The change of the guard<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
Kids, they laugh<br>
As fire it eats up the world<br>
It's such a strange celebration<br>
All our eyes are burned by heaven and Earth<br>
It's such a strange celebration
