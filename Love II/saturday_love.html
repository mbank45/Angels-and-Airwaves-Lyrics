"Saturday Love"<br>
<br>
I know that I can't tell you<br>
This light is slowly fading<br>
Like mail that was never dated<br>
From towns that were burned and raided<br>
And lost without a soul<br>
With you forever more<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I can't tell you<br>
I feel like a pattern<br>
A shape that will never matter<br>
A color that will never flatter<br>
It's all gonna come around<br>
It's all gonna make your eyes burn<br>
<br>
I really wanna tell you<br>
That love is like a furnace<br>
That burns in and out of purpose<br>
So hot that it makes me nervous<br>
So large that it won't cool out<br>
So big that it can't burn out<br>
<br>
I wait sixteen, a Saturday love<br>
My heart beats fast, in far away love<br>
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up<br>
You stay with me, we never grow up<br>
My love<br>
<br>
I know that I can't tell you<br>
My mind is running circles<br>
My eyes have begun to swirl<br>
Like death that is not as sterile<br>
I ain't gonna let you down<br>
I ain't gonna let you leave me<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I can't tell you<br>
That life that it makes me crazy<br>
So I just like to daydream<br>
Cause dreams yeah they make me happy<br>
Will you come along, my love?<br>
Will you come along here with me?<br>
<br>
I wait sixteen, a Saturday love<br>
My heart beats fast, in far away love<br>
Your eyes so pure, they never grow up<br>
You stay with me, we never grow up<br>
My love
