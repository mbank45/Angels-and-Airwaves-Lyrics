"Dry Your Eyes"<br>
<br>
A Waterfall a wonderful bliss<br>
But a Teardrop Falls<br>
You say your goodbye it means nothin<br>
<br>
I say that we tried and we gave our all<br>
You fall to the floor I'm not buyin<br>
I'm not for this and all you ever do is stall<br>
I am so damn sick of tryin<br>
And now we are fucked cause we've wrecked it all<br>
I will not save you<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
So Dry your eyes<br>
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry<br>
Or fix you and I<br>
Yeah we're here again<br>
So follow me in<br>
Today is the day it ends<br>
<br>
I can't complain it's been good, not great<br>
But the time flew by<br>
It came from behind, it was flying<br>
It was hard to hold on every time we'd fight<br>
And though it would end, it's exhausting<br>
It left cracks that would grow in and out of mine<br>
And into your heart like a virus<br>
It would crawl and would crawl and we lay there blind<br>
It broke you and I<br>
<br>
[Chorus x2]<br>
So Dry your eyes<br>
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry<br>
Or fix you and I<br>
Yeah we're here again<br>
So follow me in, today is the day it ends<br>
<br>
So Dry your eyes<br>
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry<br>
Or fix you and I<br>
Yeah we're here again<br>
So follow me in, today is the day it ends<br>
<br>
Today it ends (ends ends ends)<br>
Today it ends (ends ends ends)<br>
<br>
[Chorus x2]<br>
So Dry your eyes<br>
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry<br>
Or fix you and I<br>
Yeah we're here again<br>
So follow me in, today is the day it ends<br>
<br>
So Dry your eyes<br>
Get on your feet don't pretend to cry<br>
Or fix you and I<br>
Yeah we're here again<br>
So follow me in, today is the day it ends
