"The Revelator"<br>
<br>
Can you tell me your name girl?<br>
Are you calling me out?<br>
Are you walking my way?<br>
Are you losing your faith?<br>
Cause you make lots of noise dear<br>
Are you looking for fires?<br>
Or a group of more liars?<br>
Are you using your faith?<br>
When we all have a choice then<br>
We act like a man<br>
Will you raise up your hands?<br>
When the shit hits the fan<br>
Turn white as a ghost<br>
As the air leaves your throat<br>
Will you throw me a rope?<br>
Or go at it alone?<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
It's a little late<br>
In a little while<br>
Can we forget about it?<br>
With a little lake<br>
Of a little fire<br>
Well take the fun out of it<br>
Pour a little wine<br>
Take a little kneel<br>
Pack a little bag<br>
And a wallet<br>
Get a bit of ice<br>
And a heavy meal<br>
There is no easy way out<br>
As you pray for the end to come<br>
All you'll get is a marching line<br>
As you wait for the hounds of hell<br>
You'll be in for a big surprise<br>
<br>
Can you tell me your name girl?<br>
Does the cat have your tongue?<br>
Are you calling someone?<br>
Are you waiting to run?<br>
When the show will arrive<br>
It will be right on time<br>
So you better sit tight<br>
It will be a great ride<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
It's a little late<br>
In a little while<br>
Can we forget about it?<br>
With a little lake<br>
Of a little fire<br>
Well take the fun out of it<br>
Pour a little wine<br>
Take a little kneel<br>
Pack a little bag<br>
And a wallet<br>
Get a bit of ice<br>
And a heavy meal<br>
There is no easy way out<br>
As you pray for the end to come<br>
All you'll get is a marching line<br>
As you wait for the hounds of hell<br>
You'll be in for a big surprise<br>
Cause the end, it will never come<br>
But were in for a few hard times<br>
And we'll get knocked up down and done<br>
But the truth is were still alive<br>
<br>
Where we going<br>
Come on over<br>
No ones dying<br>
Were fine<br>
<br>
As you pray for the end to come<br>
All you'll get is a marching line<br>
As you wait for the hounds of hell<br>
You'll be in for a big surprise<br>
Cause the end, it will never come<br>
But were in for a few hard times<br>
And well get knocked up down and done<br>
But the truth is were still alive<br>
Where we going<br>
Come on over<br>
No ones dying<br>
Were fine
