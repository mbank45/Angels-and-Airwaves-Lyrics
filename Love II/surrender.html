"Surrender"<br>
<br>
There is a crowd in here<br>
That fooled themselves<br>
They brought their friends and they made their hell<br>
They fake their grin in a lonely cell<br>
To the bitter end, but what do I know?<br>
<br>
There are a few in here that hurt themselves<br>
They kick and bend in a dried up well<br>
They call for help and you know them well<br>
Are you aware of what do I know?<br>
<br>
I, I will not surrender<br>
No I, I will not surrender<br>
No I, I will not surrender<br>
No I, I will not surrender<br>
<br>
When god falls fast asleep<br>
The kids still dance in city streets<br>
From the white house lawn<br>
To the middle east<br>
And all around<br>
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now<br>
<br>
When god falls fast asleep<br>
The kids still move to a steady beat<br>
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet<br>
Or all around<br>
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now<br>
<br>
There is a place to hide,<br>
It's in our minds, it's in the dark<br>
<br>
It's well known that we have a fragile heart that's deep inside<br>
It has a sound that you can follow<br>
You feel like you hit a wall, but you survived<br>
And it was hard for you to swallow<br>
I've been to that place before<br>
In spite of luck, and you awake a new tomorrow<br>
<br>
I, I will not surrender<br>
No I, I will not surrender<br>
No I, I will not surrender<br>
No I, I will not surrender<br>
<br>
When god falls fast asleep<br>
The kids still dance in city streets<br>
From the white house lawn<br>
To the middle east<br>
And all around<br>
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now<br>
<br>
When god falls fast asleep<br>
The kids still move to a steady beat<br>
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet<br>
Or all around<br>
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now<br>
<br>
When god falls fast asleep<br>
The kids still dance in city streets<br>
From the white house lawn<br>

The kids still move to a steady beat<br>
Even if it's bombs landing at their feet<br>
Or all around<br>
I'm just saying that this time I feel it now<br>
I feel it now<br>
This time I feel it now<br>
I feel it now<br>
This time I feel it now<br>
<br>
This time I feel it now.
