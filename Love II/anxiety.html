"Anxiety"<br>
<br>
Anxiety, don't pressure us<br>
<br>
Faster, I dream in speeds of ashes<br>
My heart it beats and crashes<br>
I'm running from the truth<br>
Cause it fucks with my mind<br>
<br>
Waiting, we're silly, we're so reckless<br>
The city it's so heartless<br>
A bottle full of crude<br>
That washed up in the tide<br>
<br>
Don't pressure us, anxiety<br>
I'm a passenger<br>
So serious, anxiety<br>
Just a passenger<br>
<br>
Handsome and calloused, young believers<br>
Hiding, plotting schemers<br>
And rotting out like fruit<br>
That was left here to die<br>
<br>
Talking, playing after hours<br>
Time is bending outward<br>
I'm falling to my knees<br>
To crawl home safe inside<br>
<br>
Don't pressure us, anxiety<br>
I'm a passenger<br>
So dangerous, anxiety<br>
Just a passenger<br>
<br>
Don't pressure, us anxiety<br>
I'm a passenger<br>
So serious, anxiety<br>
Just a passenger<br>
<br>
(Don't pressure us)<br>
<br>
(Don't pressure us)<br>
<br>
(Don't pressure us)<br>
<br>
(Don't pressure us)<br>
<br>
Anxiety<br>
I'm a passenger, anxiety<br>
Just a passenger, anxiety<br>
<br>
Don't pressure us, anxiety<br>
I'm a passenger<br>
So serious, anxiety<br>
Just a passenger
