"A Little's Enough" <br>
 <br>
When all is said and done <br>
Will we still feel pain inside?<br>
Will the scars go away with night? <br>
Try to smile for the morning light <br>
It's like the best dream to have <br>
Where every thing is not so bad <br>
Every tear is so alone <br>
Like God himself is coming home to say <br>
 <br>
I, I can do anything <br>
If you want me here <br>
And I can fix any thing <br>
If you let me near <br>
Where are those secrets now <br>
That you're too scared to tell <br>
I'd whisper them all aloud <br>
So you can hear yourself <br>
 <br>
Green trees were the first sign <br>
The deepest blue, the clearest sky <br>
The silence came with the brightest eyes <br>
And turned water into wine <br>
The children ran to see <br>
The parents stood in disbelief <br>
And those who knew braced for the ride <br>
The earth itself then came alive to say <br>
 <br>
I, I can do anything <br>
If you want me here <br>
And I can fix anything <br>
If you let me near <br>
Where are those secrets now <br>
That you're too scared to tell <br>
I whisper them all aloud <br>
So you can hear yourself <br>
<br>
I'm sorry I have to say it but you look like you're sad <br>
Your smile is gone; I've noticed it bad <br>
The cure is if you let in just a little more love <br>
I promise you this, a little's enough <br>
[x6] <br>
<br>
(Just a little...)
