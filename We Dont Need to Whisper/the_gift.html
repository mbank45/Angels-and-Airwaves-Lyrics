"The Gift" <br>
 <br>
There's the strangest excitement today, <br>
if you're awake then you're welcome to hear. <br>
I got a gift and it blew me away, <br>
from the far eastern sea straight to here <br>
Oh God I feel like I'm in for it now, <br>
it's like the rush has gone straight to my brain. <br>
But my voice is as lonely as loud, <br>
as I whisper the joy of this pain. <br>
 <br>
And suddenly, <br>
you've done it all. <br>
You've won me over, <br>
in no time at all. <br>
 <br>
And now I'll stop the storm if it rains <br>
I'll light a path far from here <br>
I'll make your fear melt away <br>
And the world we know disappear. <br>
 <br>
If you ask I will do what you say <br>
All we have is this night to get through <br>
With a twist of your smile your own way <br>
you left me all up in arms and confused <br>
Oh God I feel like I'm in for it now <br>
And how this kiss will be wonderfully vain <br>
I swear I'll melt if you touch me at all, <br>
but then I'll ask you to do it again and again <br>
 <br>
And suddenly, <br>
you've done it all. <br>
You've won me over, <br>
in no time at all. <br>
 <br>
And now I'll stop the storm if it rains <br>
I'll light a path far from here <br>
I'll make your fear melt away <br>
And the world we know disappear. <br>
 <br>
I'll stop the storm if it rains <br>
I'll light a path far from here <br>
I'll make your fear melt away <br>
And the world we know disappear. <br>
 <br>
And now I'll stop the storm if it rains <br>
I'll light a path far from here <br>
I'll make your fear melt away <br>
And the world we know disappear. <br>
 <br>
I'll stop the storm if it rains <br>
I'll light a path far from here <br>
I'll make your fear melt away <br>
And the world we know disappear. <br>
 <br>
Make the world we know disappear. <br>
