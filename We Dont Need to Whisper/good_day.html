"Good Day" <br>
 <br>
[Whispering:] <br>
We don't need to whisper <br>
 <br>
I should have turned back <br>
I should have known better <br>
Than to walk away defeated <br>
I'll say it tonight, I'll say it forever <br>
And this time I really swear I mean it <br>
 <br>
Oh I need you now <br>
The Earth fell fast asleep <br>
This room is safe and sound <br>
Will you lay here with me <br>
And feel it.. <br>
 <br>
I think I like today <br>
I think its good <br>
Its something I can't get my head around <br>
 <br>
True love is something that comes easy <br>
Just one kiss god I swear I want to... <br>
I heard a pin drop and a nervous heartbeat <br>
Have you ever heard me scream I love you <br>
 <br>
Oh I need you now <br>
The Earth fell fast asleep <br>
This room is safe and sound <br>
Will you lay here with me <br>
And feel it.. <br>
 <br>
I think I like today <br>
I think it's good <br>
Its something I can't get my head around [x2] <br>
 <br>
dadah da dah dah dadadah [x8] <br>
 <br>
I think I like today <br>
I think it's good <br>
Its something I can't get my head around [x6] <br>
