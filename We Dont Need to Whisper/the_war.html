"The War" <br>
 <br>
The ocean, is on fire <br>
The sky turned dark again <br>
As the boats came in <br>
And the beaches <br>
Stretched out with soldiers <br>
With their arms and guns <br>
It has just begun <br>
 <br>
Believe, you want this <br>
Believe, I want this too <br>
 <br>
Why won't you tell me that <br>
It's almost over? <br>
Why must this <br>
Tear my head <br>
Inside out? <br>
 <br>
And the houses <br>
Laid out like targets <br>
With the deafening sound <br>
We watched them all go down <br>
And the families <br>
Now useless bodies <br>
They lay still black and blue <br>
A gift from us to you <br>
 <br>
Believe, you want this? <br>
Believe, do I want this too? <br>
 <br>
Why won't you tell me that <br>
It's almost over? <br>
Why must this <br>
Tear my head <br>
Inside out? <br>
 <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh (Believe) <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh (Believe, you want this too) <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
 <br>
Why won't you tell me that <br>
It's almost over? <br>
Why must this <br>
Tear my head <br>
Inside out? <br>

Why won't you tell me that <br>
It's almost over? <br>
Why must this <br>
Tear my head <br>
Inside out? <br>

Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
Oh oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh oh, oh oh <br>
