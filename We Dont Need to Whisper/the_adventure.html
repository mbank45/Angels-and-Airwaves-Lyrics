"The Adventure" <br>
 <br>
I wanna have the same last dream again, <br>
The one where I wake up and I'm alive. <br>
Just as the four walls close me within, <br>
My eyes are opened up with pure sunlight. <br>
I'm the first to know, <br>
My dearest friends, <br>
Even if your hope has burned with time, <br>
Anything that's dead shall be re-grown, <br>
And your vicious pain, your warning sign, <br>
You will be fine. <br>

Hello, here I am, <br>
And here we go, life's waiting to begin. <br>
 <br>
Any type of love - it will be shown, <br>
Like every single tree reach for the sky. <br>
If you're gonna fall, <br>
I'll let you know, <br>
That I will pick you up <br>
Like you for I, <br>
I felt this thing, <br>
I can't replace. <br>
Where everyone was working for this goal. <br>
Where all the children left without a trace, <br>
Only to come back, as pure as gold, <br>
To recite this all. <br>
 <br>
Hello, here I am, <br>
And here we go, life's waiting to begin. <br>
Tonight, <br>
Hello, here I am, <br>
And here we go, life's waiting to begin. <br>
Tonight, <br>
Hello, here I am, <br>
And here we go, life's waiting to begin. <br>
 <br>
I cannot live, I can't breathe <br>
Unless you do this with me <br>
I cannot live, I can't breathe <br>
Unless you do this with me <br>
I cannot live, I can't breathe <br>
Unless you do this with me <br>
I cannot live, I can't breathe <br>
Unless you do this with me <br>
I cannot live, I can't breathe <br>
Unless you do this with me <br>
I cannot live, I can't breathe <br>
Unless you do this with me <br>
 <br>
Hello, here I am (do this with me), <br>
And here we go, life's waiting to begin (do this with me). <br>
Hello, here I am (do this with me). <br>
And here we go, life's waiting to begin, <br>
Life's waiting to begin. <br>
