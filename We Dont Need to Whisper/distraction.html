"Distraction"<br>
<br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
<br>
There's a field nearby <br>
With words written in stone<br>
My love will not die <br>
Please let it be known <br>
This place is dead <br>
It echoes through town <br>
There isn't one voice <br>
I haven't heard a sound <br>
The planes flew in <br>
Their bombs did too <br>
The city fell flat <br>
The fires, they grew <br>
When the smoke comes in <br>
It'll color this town <br>
But I'll still have you <br>
So I'll say it aloud <br>
 <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
 <br>
The friendship we made <br>
Is a waste of our time <br>
There's no one left here <br>
To show future that's kind <br>
It's a world of hate <br>
Gone incredibly wrong <br>
We cared too late <br>
We just followed along <br>
And the boys went down <br>
With a gun in their hand <br>
Their weapon of choice <br>
Their knees in the sand <br>
If that field nearby <br>
Was still there to be used <br>
Would you ever have known? <br>
Those words were for you <br>
 <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
 <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
I'll be your distraction <br>
 <br>
I'll be, I'll be yours <br>
I'll be, I'll be yours <br>
I'll be, I'll be yours <br>
I'll be, I'll be yours <br>
