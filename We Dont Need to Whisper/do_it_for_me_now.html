"Do It For Me Now" <br>
 <br>
I'm frightened at night and the wind has a roar <br>
It seeps through the hall and from under the door <br>
Like the shit that was said <br>
I can't take it that well <br>
I give and I give and I give and I give and I'm still <br>
Lost and hurt and bone thin from the love that's been starved <br>
I know it got close but I'm sure it's too far <br>
From the point of suspense, we know it should be <br>
The end of that part of our favorite movie <br>
When the guy grabs the girl and gives her his hand <br>
Says take me away from this torturous land <br>
Cause the grave is set up, the hole that I dug <br>
I gave and I gave and I gave and I gave you my trust <br>
Like the time that we kissed and you gave me a lie <br>
To add to the scene you pretended to cry <br>
But I'm here and I'm cool, the way that it is <br>
Just give me a chance and I'll try to forgive <br>
 <br>
And I don't know <br>
And I can't guess <br>
If we're gonna be OK <br>
But now my last wish <br>
Is that you do this with me <br>
Kiss me here and hold my hand <br>
Let me feel like I'm the only one <br>
I know you can <br>
Won't you do it for me now? <br>
 <br>
I've really had it with the rain of the tears <br>
The predictable storm that has come every year <br>
And it sneaks in from shore with a bat in it's hand <br>
I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying I can't <br>
You're a thief and a witch but I love you to death <br>
You steal my heart and curse under your breath <br>
But the one thing that I can most willingly prove <br>
That when you are gone I'll be fine without you <br>
 <br>
And I don't know <br>
And I can't guess <br>
If we're gonna be OK <br>
But now my last wish <br>
Is that you do this with me <br>
Kiss me here and hold my hand <br>
Let me feel like I'm the only one <br>
I know you can <br>
Won't you do it for me now? <br>
 <br>
Now just hold on, hold on to me <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me (hold on to me) <br>
Hold on, hold on to me <br>
 <br>
