"Valkyrie Missile" <br>

</br>
[Spoken transmissions:]<br>
Do you hear me out there I can hear you.<br>
I got you I can hear you alright.<br>
This is so strange,<br>
I want to wish for something new,<br>
This is the scariest thing I've ever done in my life,<br>
Who do we think we are?<br>
We're Angels and Airwaves<br>
Just hold on I got you.<br>
I can see the sun coming up on the horizon.<br>
[Spoken transmission Ends:]<br>
<br>
Everyone, everyone will listen<br>
Even if it hurts sometimes<br>
If you will, come and hear the message<br>
Everyone wants to learn to love again<br>
Open up and come alive if you will<br>
Can you hear my message?<br>
Leave your pain on the bedroom floor again<br>
Bring a smile to survive<br>
And do you think that you have that in you<br>
If you're here and you're all alone tonight<br>
Then I'll give you a free ride<br>
Take a chance 'cause I know you want to<br>
<br>
If only you'll hold on, just hold on<br>
I'm here and I'm with you<br>
I'm here too, I feel you<br>
We'll get through<br>
I know this, I've seen it<br>
A hundred times, a thousand times<br>
Just one more time<br>
With you and I, I'll pull you close<br>
And then we'll say goodbye<br>
<br>
I've got a lotta, whole hell of a lot to say<br>
Even if it hurts sometimes<br>
And if you will come and hear the message<br>
And everyone, everyone will hope and pray<br>
That the best will sure survive<br>
And if it's true then you'll feel the message<br>
A perfect life for a perfect brand new day<br>
And we're the next in line<br>
And do you think that you have it in you<br>
So if you're here and you're curious tonight<br>
Then I'll give you a free ride<br>
Take a chance 'cause I know you want to<br>
<br>
If only you'll hold on, just hold on<br>
I'm here and I'm with you<br>
I'm here too, I feel you<br>
We'll get through<br>
I know this, I've seen it<br>
A hundred times, a thousand times<br>
Just one more time<br>
With you and I, I'll pull you close<br>
And then we'll say goodbye<br>
<br>
