"Start The Machine" <br>
 <br>
The ash set in then blew away <br>
It's getting lost into the sea <br>
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had to leave forever <br>
I left the chill and voice of screams and kids and ran for shelter <br>
 <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
The pain has a bad reaction <br>
A blend of fear and passion <br>
You know what it's like to believe <br>
It makes me wanna scream <br>
 <br>
I see a glow from far away <br>
A faint reflection on the sea <br>
I left some words quite far from here to be a short reminder <br>
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever <br>
 <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
The pain has a bad reaction <br>
A blend of fear and passion <br>
You know what it's like to believe <br>
It makes me wanna scream <br>
 <br>
I see the stars, they're in your eyes <br>
A playful kiss, can you tell I'm excited? <br>
A fast escape in the nick of time <br>
If you lost your wish, can I help you find it? <br>
I'm on my knee, just one to start <br>
A fresh new start, don't be undecided <br>
 <br>
If love's a word, that you say <br>
Then say it, I will listen <br>
If love's a word, that you say <br>
Then say it, I will listen <br>
If love's a word, that you say <br>
Then say it, I will listen <br>
If love's a word, that you say <br>
Then say it, I will listen <br>
If love's a word, that you say <br>
Then say it, I will listen <br>
If love's a word, that you say <br>
Then say it, I will listen (I will listen) <br>
