"The Machine" <br>
 <br>
The ash set in and blew away <br>
It's getting lost into the sea <br>
I grew so close to all the thoughts I had to leave forever, <br>
I left the chill and voice of screams and kids and ran for shelter <br>
 <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
The pain has a bad reaction <br>
A blend of fear and passion <br>
You know what it's like to believe <br>
It makes me wanna scream. <br>
 <br>
I see a glow from far away <br>
A faint reflection on the sea <br>
I left some words quite far from here to be a short reminder <br>
I laid them out in stone in case they need to last forever. <br>
 <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
You know I won't say sorry <br>
The pain has a bad reaction <br>
A blend of fear and passion <br>
You know what it's like to believe <br>
It makes me wanna scream. <br>
 <br>
You know what it's like to believe... <br>
It makes me wanna scream. <br>
