"It Hurts" <br>
 <br>
It hurts... [x17] <br>
 <br>
Is this what you want? <br>
'Cause everybody acts without a clue <br>
Every little kiss and grin you gave <br>
Was just a little bullshit I saw through <br>
 <br>
The alcohol is scented with your breath <br>
You're always all done up to just be used <br>
I'm waiting for excuses that deceive <br>
I'll meet you in the back to see them through <br>
 <br>
How did I let her inside? <br>
We're dripping of sweat, I'm feeling alright <br>
Her lips were the last thing touched tonight <br>
Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
 <br>
It hurts... [x17] <br>
 <br>
Are you out of your mind? <br>
You dug yourself into a liar's hole <br>
You made a little spark to live inside <br>
It's now a fucking fire out of control <br>
And when the morning comes you'll act surprised <br>
And when the word gets out it will get old <br>
And every day you'll try to live your life <br>
And every little scandal will unfold <br>
 <br>
How did I let her inside? <br>
We're dripping of sweat, I'm feeling alright <br>
Her lips were the last thing touched tonight <br>
Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
 <br>
Sherrie, do you want it? <br>
Sherrie, I want it too <br>
Sherrie, do you want it? <br>
Sherrie, I want it too <br>
 <br>
How did I let her inside? <br>
We're dripping of sweat, I'm feeling alright <br>
Her lips were the last thing touched tonight <br>
Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
 <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) <br>
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts) Your best friend is not your girlfriend <br>
