“The Moon-Atomic (…Fragments And Fictions)”<br>
<br>
It’s like the day has turned to rust<br>
Like every dreams been sealed shut<br>
Like every door is closed before we’ve gotten out<br>
As bullets rip the air in two from house to house<br>
<br>
We are all that we are, so terribly sorry<br>
We are all that we are, so terribly sorry<br>
<br>
The moon you’ve felt, it has no side<br>
That’s dark like hell, or safe from light<br>
Just blown apart, by wind from stars<br>
With white dust tides to pull on ours<br>
<br>
The moon you’ve felt, it has no side<br>
That’s dark like hell, or safe from light<br>
Just blown apart, by wind from stars<br>
With white dust tides to pull on ours<br>
<br>
I see the crowds their giving way<br>
For some, they’re better off that day<br>
The bombs blew off the shells<br>
Their glowing red at burst<br>
The less there is to feel each night upon the earth<br>
<br>
We are all that we are, so terribly sorry<br>
We are all that we are, so terribly sorry<br>
<br>
The moon you’ve felt, it has no side<br>
That’s dark like hell, or safe from light<br>
Just blown apart, by wind from stars<br>
With white dust tides to pull on ours<br>
