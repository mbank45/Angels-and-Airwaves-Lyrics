“Soul Survivor (…2012)”<br>
<br>
I am a ghost, this is a dream<br>
There’s something here, it calls to me<br>
I sense it cuz it’s always there<br>
So silent as I stare and stare<br>
There is a light, when we’re asleep<br>
Were barely doors, with locks and keys<br>
With feelings of our hopes and fears<br>
As sounds explode within our ears<br>
<br>
Like stars at night falling fast asleep <br>
On the risen sun, wait patiently <br>
You can feel it cuz it’s always there<br>
Light stronger as you stare and stare<br>
Like love and lies shake violently<br>
Down to the core to foster grief<br>
It has a way to keep me down<br>
I gotta say it wears me out<br>
<br>
So sadly soul survivors<br>
Lost and lonely in open water<br>
Yeah oh, yeah oh, yeah oh<br>
Yeah oh..<br>
<br>
Help I’m losing, help I’m falling<br>
Life is silent, the earth is calling<br>
Every reason, every nighttime<br>
And every day starts and ends in sunlight<br>
But I’m not okay with this vicious cycle<br>
Somethings broken, it seems unnatural<br>
These shapes are wondrous, but loosely woven<br>
The sounds are deafening, and time is frozen<br>
<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
Yo oh oh oh<br>
<br>
So sadly soul survivors<br>
Lost and lonely in open water<br>
Yeah oh, yeah oh, yeah oh<br>
Yeah oh..<br>
<br>
So sadly soul survivors<br>
Lost and lonely in open water<br>
Yeah oh, yeah oh, yeah oh<br>
Yeah oh..<br>
