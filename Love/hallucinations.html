“Hallucinations”<br>
<br>
And you look real close<br>
Cross the lines and the roads<br>
It is there to decode<br>
What you thought was a ghost<br>
Or a spark to explode<br>
It’s the start of the show<br>
It’s the part you love the most<br>
When your heart will implode within<br>
<br>
Do you believe in hallucinations, silly dreams or imaginations<br>
Don’t go away cause I feel you this time<br>
Don’t go away cause I need you there this time<br>
<br>
As the rain floats home<br>
Carry us back to shore<br>
And up the mountainous coast<br>
Where the sun starts to glow<br>
From our head to our toes<br>
To the stars that we know<br>
And with you as my host<br>
It will keep us afloat again<br>
<br>
Do you believe in hallucinations, silly dreams or imaginations<br>
Don’t go away cause I feel you this time<br>
Don’t go away cause I need you there this time<br>
Do you believe in hallucinations, any dream or it’s revelation<br>
Don’t go away cause I need you there this time<br>
Don’t go away cause I’m making you all mine<br>
<br>
The silence is taxing<br>
I’m waiting for something<br>
There’s images of love and war<br>
And everything’s here to explore<br>
It’s all alike, unusual, a different place<br>
But beautiful and it is not quite as it seems<br>
I hear the children’s laughs and screams<br>
<br>
It’s beautiful<br>
So beautiful<br>
It’s beautiful<br>
<br>
Do you believe in hallucinations, silly dreams or imaginations<br>
Don’t go away cause I feel you this time<br>
Don’t go away cause I need you there this time<br>
Do you believe in hallucinations, any dream or it’s revelation<br>
Don’t go away cause I need you there this time<br>
Don’t go away cause I’m making you all mine
