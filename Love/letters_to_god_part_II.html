“Letters To God, Part II”<br>
<br>
All the phones have rung and rung<br>
They are off the hook, all but one<br>
And all the mail stacked up inside<br>
Up from the floor, a mile high<br>
<br>
And like one would, like a child<br>
I’m asking..<br>
Like I could knock on your door<br>
Will you let me in?<br>
<br>
And dear God, I found out the same things we learn when we die<br>
I found out the truth is it’s all a big lie<br>
I find that the words are hard to describe<br>
I tell you I’m lost here, awaiting reply<br>
<br>
Climbing trees and paper planes<br>
Life as a kid, we’re all the same<br>
Tears of joy, and sullen hearts<br>
Sticks and stones and broken arms<br>
<br>
And like one would, like a child<br>
I’m asking..<br>
Like I could knock on your door<br>
Will you let me in?<br>
<br>
And dear God, I found out the same things we learn when we die<br>
I found out the truth is it’s all a big lie<br>
I find that the words are hard to describe<br>
I tell you I’m lost here, awaiting reply<br>
I found out what’s wrong, and it’s not you or I<br>
Or anyone else that you chose tonight<br>
It seems like the madness of choice in the life<br>
Has made it all clear if we run or we hide<br>
