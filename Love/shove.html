“Shove”<br>
<br>
Forget the things that you own<br>
And travel almost anywhere you can go<br>
Dance across the tree tips, set them ablaze<br>
Soaking in their pleasant warm summer haze<br>
And weeping on her streets and school city blocks<br>
And finding streams on her while you’re skipping rocks<br>
And feeding on her touch as it will barely keep you alive<br>
<br>
She said show me the world that’s inside your head,<br>
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help<br>
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love<br>
<br>
It can be so bold and so cavalier<br>
To reach out to the fire her souls sending here<br>
It can be like death that blows like a breeze<br>
Making all ones strength go weak at the knees<br>
I hate to feel the shallow ground giving way<br>
I’ve never let myself fall this much astray<br>
And feeding on her touch is all one does to survive<br>
<br>
She said show me the world that’s inside your head,<br>
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help<br>
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love<br>
<br>
She said show me the world that’s inside your head,<br>
Tell me your secrets of life and death, and your one regret<br>
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love<br>
<br>
She said show me the world that’s inside your head,<br>
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help<br>
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love<br>
<br>
She said show me the world that’s inside your head,<br>
Tell me your secrets of life and death, and your one regret<br>
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love<br>
<br>
If you’re ever alone, then your heart will know<br>
It can call to mine, and I’ll be at your side<br>
If you’re ever alone, then your heart will know<br>
It can reach to mine, I’ll be at your side
