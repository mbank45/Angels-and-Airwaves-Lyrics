“Young London”<br>

I’m not the one to complain of bad dreams<br>
It’s like disease, but without a life<br>
It’s all a scene with this great directive<br>
That we’re all lost and we’re stuck in time<br>
We feel alone in a strange blue ocean<br>
And we’re all scared as death to die<br>
<br>
I’m not the one to admit it’s helpless<br>
I have a sense that we will be alright<br>
I wish for peace with electric silence<br>
To keep our hearts beating on our minds<br>
And we will see that we’re all connected<br>
When we awake to the tunnel’s light<br>
<br>
Suit up, boys<br>
We’re on vacation<br>
With endless stay and reservations<br>
Saddest girls<br>
Who will await while dying inside<br>
How will they get by?<br>

Suit up, boys<br>
Let’s ride, it’s the weekend<br>
Get down, girls<br>
And dance with your best friend<br>
Show yourselves, and take what you ask for<br>
Let it go, no fights on the dance floor<br>

The night gets better, but wait, so wonderful<br>
They move together and dance so colorful<br>
And kiss like flowers that breathe with pheromones<br>
Songs get louder, it feels so natural<br>
