“Clever Love”<br>
<br>
Oh I know you well<br>
All your life I’ve watched you breathe<br>
I’ve watched you lie across the seam through space and time<br>
Through every year of every kind<br>
I’d wait like snow, on the eve of spring<br>
I can out last cold, can you out last me?<br>
Every word you say, is a perfect thing<br>
It’s the perfect time, for the perfect love<br>
<br>
And you oh, you’re all I desire<br>
And you oh, this clever love won’t tire<br>
<br>
Oh I’ve felt your spell<br>
And all alike, it’s been like hell<br>
Every single time the cycle goes<br>
In and out of mind, in and out of fear, of getting left behind<br>
I see your glow, your eyes are kind, they kill as well<br>
I bare in mind, every word I say is a silent thing<br>
And a solid wish, will you lay with me?<br>
<br>
And you oh, you’re all I desire<br>
And you oh, this clever love won’t tire<br>
And you oh, you’re all I desire<br>
And you oh, our clever love caught fire<br>
<br>
And you oh, you’re all I desire<br>
And you oh, this clever love won’t tire<br>
And you oh, you’re all I desire<br>
And you oh, our clever love won’t tire<br>
<br>
And you oh, you’re all I desire<br>
And you oh, our clever love caught fire<br>
<br>
You’re all that I want, your that I need<br>
You’re my everything<br>
You’re all that I want, your that I need<br>
You’re my everything<br>
