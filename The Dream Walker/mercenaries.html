"Mercenaries"<br>
<br>
Can you come on<br>
out of the cold<br>
How do we make it out alive<br>
<br>
Get a weapon<br>
Lockin the door<br>
Stayin awake to stay alive<br>
<br>
Kill the fallen<br>
Knife in the back<br>
Plan of attack<br>
A beady eye<br>
<br>
As you follow<br>
Head out the pack<br>
Flood out the rat<br>
And stab em' dry<br>
<br>
Got ya' come on<br>
Goin in deep<br>
Falling asleep<br>
an open door<br>
<br>
Get the ballast<br>
Crawl up the coast<br>
Pull on the neck<br>
And cut the cord<br>
<br>
Can you hold it<br>
Get me a rope<br>
Combing the lake of fire god<br>
<br>
Like a bullet<br>
Follow the smoke<br>
Head of the snake<br>
and cut it off<br>
<br>
Ghosts heroing front lines<br>
On a lonely cove<br>
And they left behind<br>
A bit if sorrow<br>
<br>
You didn't need to count me out<br>
When the final push is a little weight on your neck sometimes<br>
<br>
You didn't need to count me out<br>
When your feeling low here's a little hand from above because your on my mind<br>
<br>
You kinda got it<br>
Further a cause<br>
Broaden the reach<br>
<br>
a little pain<br>
Like a comet burn up and die<br>
Hear a pin drop a mile away<br>
<br>
Like a disease<br>
move with a tease<br>
Glide of the feet<br>
an atom bomb<br>
<br>
As your dieing<br>
both of your knees<br>
Will fall to the street<br>
You'll carry on
