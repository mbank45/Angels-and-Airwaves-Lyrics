"The Disease"<br>
<br>
Take a little look at yourself<br>
Watch a soul leave the cemetery<br>
Find a little fight in those eyes<br>
And awaken to light across the sky<br>
<br>
Dream a little harder this time<br>
I'll await you to make the journey<br>
Letting go the love realize<br>
It's as much of the end, as is the ride<br>
<br>
I await you again<br>
I can feel your touch<br>
I call your name to the wind<br>
And into the nightfall my love<br>
<br>
Carry up the worst of yourself<br>
To a maze so in-ordinary<br>
Get a little taste of it all<br>
And awaken so new, your friends, a child<br>
<br>
If you want to stay through the night<br>
Hear the footsteps and sullen stories<br>
Feels like the night of your life<br>
All the reason to brave all the smiles<br>
<br>
And I, await you again<br>
I can feel your touch<br>
I call your name to the wind<br>
And into the nightfall my love<br>
<br>
I keep your heart next to mine<br>
And when the nights get rough<br>
I reach for you deep inside<br>
I reach for you there, my love
