"Tunnels"<br>
<br>
I am still, without devotion<br>
Cause we're all asleep at the wheel<br>
Asleep and so surrounded by<br>
What we feel<br>
<br>
A bad dream<br>
<br>
On a rope and pulled through an ocean<br>
With my heart, I'm lost out at sea<br>
And every kind of thought screams misery<br>
<br>
So lonely<br>
<br>
I'm a Johnny-come-lately<br>
But I will not give up<br>
And the words they escape me<br>
But I'm full of dumb luck<br>
And the world is an oyster<br>
With a poisonous shell<br>
And the look in my eye<br>
Is a look that can kill<br>
<br>
I am not (dream a bit) without emotion<br>
I have ran from the pain of my will<br>
From the mess of a hunt and the catch, and the thrill<br>
And I'm ill<br>
<br>
I am known (dream a bit) in the circles of envy<br>
I'd thank God, but then what is he for?<br>
'Cause I left a few hard calls at his front door<br>
I'll leave more (dream a bit)<br>
<br>
I'm a Johnny-come-lately<br>
But I will not give up (Dream a bit)<br>
And the words they escape me<br>
But I'm full of dumb luck (Dream a bit)<br>
And the world is an oyster<br>
With a poisonous shell<br>
And the look in my eye<br>
Is a look that can kill<br>
<br>
Don't you go<br>
Come a little bit closer now<br>
If you like<br>
When you die<br>
<br>
Make your soul<br>
To a little light fire now<br>
If you like<br>
When you die<br>
<br>
Speak to me<br>
Cry a river and make believe<br>
If you like<br>
When you die<br>
<br>
Clasp your hands<br>
Do whatever your heart commands<br>
You will find<br>
When you die<br>
<br>
You are mine
