"The Wolfpack"<br>
<br>
No bother, climb to it, and call out, canary<br>
Don't worry, just grab it, or somethin', abuse it<br>
My vision, a forest, a lot here, to carry<br>
Slide over, and bite it, the apple, and bury<br>
The volume, and the riot, the smell of, the lions<br>
and the sun sets, behind me, the bullets, start flying<br>
<br>
Finding a light in a world of ruin<br>
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in<br>
We're ready to begin<br>
<br>
Its alright<br>
A bit scathed<br>
A bit lost<br>
I've been played<br>
I ain't that clever<br>
a city boy that can never say never<br>
i got the life but that girl bites like a wolf<br>
<br>
Inertia, take cover, a canon, you ready<br>
The image, the session, a poet is sleeping<br>
The current, the pilot, antennas and sirens<br>
Like college, like thieves that, can eat with the wolfpack<br>
<br>
Finding a light in a world of ruin<br>
Starting to dance when the earth is caving in<br>
Set in the sun and our hearts are burn in'<br>
Leaving the nest to the back a thousand winds<br>
We're ready to begin<br>
<br>
Its alright<br>
A bit scathed<br>
A bit lost<br>
I've been played<br>
I ain't that clever<br>
a city boy that can never say never<br>
I got the life but that girl bites like (a wolf)<br>
<br>
Its on me<br>
Its only<br>
A small heart<br>
On one sleeve<br>
Academy killer<br>
Off with his head<br>
In the make believe game of fools<br>
That girl bites like a wolf<br>
<br>
Are you ready?<br>
I'm waiting to begin
