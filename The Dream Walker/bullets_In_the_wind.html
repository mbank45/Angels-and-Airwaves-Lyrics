"Bullets In The Wind"<br>
<br>
Army, army waiting for me<br>
Set the dial to the radio free<br>
Tie 'n tether to the band on the run<br>
Pick em' up with the sound of your guns, woah-oh<br>
<br>
Call em' in, to the white of the eyes<br>
Watch em' dance, get kicked to the side<br>
Chatter up in a forbidden tongue<br>
Got you now eat the heart of the young<br>
<br>
A Ritual, the words creep out<br>
Like a ghost, the heart sinks down<br>
An Animal, teethe reach out<br>
Holding on, we're coming up strong, up again<br>
<br>
We dance like bullets in the wind<br>
Over and over again<br>
Over and over again<br>
We're bringing life back from the dead<br>
<br>
Keeping the captive alive <br>
Over and over we go<br>
Over and over we go<br>
So turn up the transistor radio<br>
<br>
Trouble trouble, get me some more <br>
Cutting deep going down to the core <br>
Great Scott, the kids in the rain<br>
We come together with the sound of a train<br>
<br>
Shut and lock with a four letter word<br>
Bite your thumb the car's gonna swerve<br>
<br>
Sound clatter, the crash city lights<br>
Hurry up- this kids gonna fight<br>
<br>
A Ritual, the words creep out<br>
Like a ghost, the heart sinks down<br>
An Animal, teethe reach out<br>
Holding on, we're coming up strong, up again<br>
<br>
We dance like bullets in the wind<br>
Over and over again<br>
Over and over again<br>
We're bringing life back from the dead<br>
<br>
Keeping the captive alive <br>
Over and over we go<br>
Over and over we go<br>
So turn up the transistor radio<br>
<br>
Pick up the beat<br>
And pry up the caskets<br>
And call in the masses<br>
And turn up the song<br>
<br>
Shuffle your feet and<br>
Exit the blackness<br>
Rise up from the ashes<br>
You're dancing along<br>
<br>
A Ritual, the words creep out<br>
Like a ghost, the heart sinks down<br>
An Animal, teethe reach out<br>
Holding on, we're coming up strong, up again<br>
<br>
We dance like bullets in the wind<br>
Over and over again<br>
Over and over again<br>
We're bringing life back from the dead<br>
<br>
Keeping the captive alive <br>
Over and over we go<br>
Over and over we go<br>
So turn up the transistor radio
