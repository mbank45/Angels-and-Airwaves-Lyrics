"Overload"<br>
<br>
Eyes<br>
Wait<br>
Go<br>
Lights<br>
Don't<br>
Haunt<br>
Through<br>
The night<br>
<br>
Everybody's coming to be shown<br>
(We see it in your eyes)<br>
Just like that feeling when you run<br>
(We see it every time)<br>
Come close find someone that you know<br>
(We all enjoy the pain)<br>
This spark is burning up the firehouse again, again<br>
<br>
Your lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie<br>
Your lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie<br>
<br>
When you see it, do you overload?<br>
Do you feel like you should close your eyes?<br>
Everybody to the great unknown<br>
Feet first, jumping in front of the line<br>
When you see it, do you overload?<br>
Do you feel like you should bide your time<br>
Every minute is an episode<br>
A-typical, dramatic end to the night<br>
<br>
Everybody is waiting on the rain<br>
(We see it in your eyes)<br>
Held down and high above the fold<br>
(We see it every time)<br>
Come close, find anyone you can<br>
(We all enjoy the pain)<br>
This spark will burn right down the fucking house again, again<br>
<br>
When you see it, do you overload?<br>
Do you feel like you should close your eyes?<br>
Everybody to the great unknown<br>
Feet first, jumping in front of the line<br>
When you see it, do you overload?<br>
Do you feel like you should bide your time<br>
Every minute is an episode<br>
A-typical, dramatic end to the night<br>
<br>
When you see it, do you overload?<br>
Do you feel like you should close your eyes?<br>
Everybody to the great unknown<br>
Feet first, jumping in front of the line<br>
When you see it, do you overload?<br>
Do you feel like you should bide your time<br>
Every minute is an episode<br>
A-typical, dramatic end to the night<br>
<br>
Lights<br>
Don't<br>
Haunt<br>
Through<br>
The night
