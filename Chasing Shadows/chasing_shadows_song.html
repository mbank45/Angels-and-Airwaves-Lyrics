"Chasing Shadows"<br>
<br>
Eighteen and a wicker basket<br>
Red cape and a open casket<br>
Tied up to a broken lever<br>
If I move, it hurts forever<br>
I am not that host<br>
But I want her<br>
<br>
Wolf in a winter playground<br>
White snow to let the red out<br>
I hear that alarms are better<br>
Than a warning, like a feather<br>
I don't like my tone<br>
But I want her<br>
<br>
[Chorus:]<br>
So here I am<br>
I'm falling to my knees<br>
I'm digging at the shadows of a ghost<br>
When you come around<br>
So here I am<br>
I'm waiting for the tease<br>
I'm sleeping in the gallows that I chose<br>
When you come around<br>
<br>
Why sleep I can't forget it<br>
Moonrise I'm now committed<br>
Your move cause I am tethered<br>
Like a slave, I don't know better<br>
I listen for your words<br>
Yeah, I want her<br>
<br>
Lost boys in a haunted forest<br>
Bright things in the maze before us<br>
My life has now been severed<br>
I can't bare to remember who I was before<br>
The day I met her<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
[Chorus x2]
