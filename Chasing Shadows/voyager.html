"Voyager"<br>
<br>
My oh my, the coast is never that clear<br>
Hate them rocks and stones, quit throwing them here<br>
Shut that door, the locust is coming inside<br>
Get out them boots and walk off that miracle mile<br>
<br>
I’m a smooth operator<br>
I’m a loose elevator<br>
<br>
Watch me as I break the television<br>
Talk me off the ledge, I can’t envision<br>
Take me to the hole to throw a wish in<br>
I am on my way, unstoppable<br>
Lock the doors and warn the federation<br>
Bright and bold, here comes the revolution<br>
My oh my, the king is on a mission<br>
I am on my way, unstoppable<br>
Pure at heart, a king infallible<br>
Great big fucking time<br>
So powerful, I<br>
<br>
My oh my, a kiss inside of my ear<br>
A cool clean fist to punch out the holiday cheer<br>
Stop everyone, stop everyone coming inside<br>
Watch out, this is the first time I’m feeling alive<br>
<br>
I’m a smooth operator<br>
I’m a loose elevator<br>
I’m a smooth operator<br>
I’m a loose elevator<br>
<br>
Watch me as I break the television<br>
Talk me off the ledge, I can’t envision<br>
Take me to the hole to throw a wish in<br>
I am on my way, unstoppable<br>
Lock the doors and warn the federation<br>
Bright and bold, here comes the revolution<br>
My oh my, the king is on a mission<br>
I am on my way, unstoppable<br>
Pure at heart, a king infallible<br>
Great big fucking time<br>
So powerful, I
