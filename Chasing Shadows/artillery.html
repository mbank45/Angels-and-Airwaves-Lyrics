"Artillery"<br>
<br>
Halloween, a fallen angel to bury the symphony<br>
Bright lights and broken stables<br>
Odd hours at the factory<br>
They never even knew my name<br>
Waiting for that victory<br>
<br>
Follow on<br>
The stars are blurry<br>
They move throughout the sky<br>
Machinery and crooked crosses<br>
The children believe the lie<br>
I never even caught your name<br>
You never even had the time<br>
<br>
Anyone, why can't you hear it<br>
A voice that's out of range<br>
Messengers and lost magicians<br>
Engage the tidal waves<br>
You never even knew my name<br>
Crying up the rivalry<br>
Waiting for a bit of shame<br>
Unplug us from the battery<br>
<br>
Artillery<br>
The words are like<br>
A death tonight<br>
They'll serve you well<br>
[x7]<br>
<br>
Artillery<br>
The words are like<br>
A death tonight<br>
They'll serve you
