"Kiss With A Spell"<br>
<br>
If I end up alone<br>
Across the barren sand dunes<br>
I see my true self<br>
I am burning inside for you<br>
Live in a curse<br>
Lost in desire<br>
Of your touch<br>
I can not hurt<br>
I can not cry, I can not... I am numb<br>
<br>
Don't say it<br>
Don't, don't say it loud<br>
Don't say it<br>
Don't, don't say it now<br>
<br>
Ohhh- I know I came in here myself<br>
To here and ever after<br>
Ohhh- you sent me a kiss, with a spell<br>
I fear the ever after<br>
<br>
A sting to the eyes<br>
The trace here of you,<br>
Still has bite<br>
It can weaken the legs<br>
Buckle knees<br>
In a fight<br>
<br>
Don't say it<br>
Don't say it loud<br>
Don't say it<br>
Don't, don't say it now<br>
<br>
Ohhh- I know I came in here myself<br>
To here and ever after -Ohhh<br>
You sent me a kiss, with a spell<br>
I fear the ever after -Ohhh<br>
I pray like the kids do in hell<br>
A child and a master -Ohhh<br>
I know that I injured myself<br>
Again and ever after<br>
<br>
Ohhh- I know I came in here myself<br>
To here and ever after -Ohhh<br>
You sent me a kiss, with a spell<br>
I fear the ever after -Ohhh<br>
I pray like the kids do in hell<br>
A child and a master -Ohhh<br>
I know that I injured myself<br>
Again and ever after
