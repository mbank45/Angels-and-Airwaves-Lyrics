"Teenagers & Rituals"<br>
<br>
Lightning cross the way, no<br>
I can't rest, been up for weeks<br>
The words they come in close<br>
They gotta a nerve that never sleeps, for me<br>
<br>
I say, I wait in rooms of gold<br>
And crawl down to my knees<br>
A liar, a thief and a coward a crime<br>
I laugh my head clean off at the sight<br>
<br>
Bop-Ba-Ba-Da-Da<br>
Pull em in close, drop into the fight<br>
Light that shit up like the Fourth of July<br>
<br>
Lonely, cat-like master<br>
Drive me. Take me faster<br>
Eye-that, side back-alley<br>
Add to the score<br>
Join in the war rally<br>
<br>
I can't recite the names<br>
Or events that come to me<br>
The blur of times and dates<br>
That a drink or two, or three, will leave<br>
<br>
I walk these streets of gold<br>
And the smell grows on my feet<br>
I cross and slide through a land of mines<br>
I await the gag and my skin to bleed<br>
<br>
Bop-Ba-Ba-Da-Da<br>
Pull em in close, drop into the fight<br>
Light that shit up like the Fourth of July<br>
<br>
Lonely, cat-like master<br>
Drive me. Take me faster<br>
Eye-that, side back-alley<br>
Add to the score<br>
Join in the war rally
