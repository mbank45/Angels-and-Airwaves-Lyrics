"Tremors"<br>
<br>
The earth is burnin'<br>
Can't feel my feet<br>
Yeah come on'<br>
<br>
The floor is sinking<br>
Through holes in the street<br>
Yeah come on<br>
<br>
Your eyes have ferried<br>
My nightmares to sleep<br>
So come on<br>
<br>
Tonight is stolen<br>
And sharpened like teeth<br>
Yeah come on<br>
<br>
I'm a ghost, hesitating<br>
I bite my tongue at your throne<br>
<br>
Meet me here half way<br>
Across elation<br>
I get off this way<br>
When I'm in love<br>
<br>
Your eyes are poison<br>
Your making me sweat<br>
So come on<br>
<br>
I keep a crucifix<br>
Hung on my neck<br>
Yeah come on<br>
<br>
Back to the cradle<br>
Your chasin' a rat<br>
So come on<br>
<br>
Don't activate that-<br>
That Plan of attack<br>
Yeah come on<br>
<br>
I'm a ghost, salivating<br>
I crave your soul, like my own<br>
<br>
Meet me here half way<br>
Across elation<br>
I get off this way<br>
When I'm in love<br>
<br>
When you scream my name, <br>
I feel I'm dying. <br>
I get off this way, <br>
when I'm in love. <br>
<br>
I get off this way, <br>
when I'm in love.
