"Paralyzed"<br>
<br>
I wake to a fire in the realm<br>
Little lion safe and sound<br>
It's a wild life, so wild crazy<br>
Can not tame the crowd<br>
<br>
White feast in the hole your an MIA<br>
A little hell, you gonna pay<br>
You're a whore at home, the telephone<br>
A king that's here to stay<br>
<br>
Sleep<br>
And awaken to life, for a hell of a ride<br>
Sleep<br>
And awaken to life, with your hands at your side-<br>
Paralyzed<br>
<br>
Out cold and regenerate the start<br>
Little lion set your fire<br>
Push away and go, in stereo<br>
A tear will death depart<br>
<br>
Nineteen with a wicked M-R-E<br>
What a waste, a memory<br>
Better study hard, and play the part<br>
Another victim to the scene<br>
<br>
Sleep<br>
And awaken to life, for a hell of a ride<br>
Sleep<br>
And awaken to life, with your hands at your side-<br>
Paralyzed<br>
<br>
Its more of the same<br>
A silly old shame<br>
A dimmly lit grove<br>
It will whither and go<br>
I climb the light post<br>
Illumanate the road<br>
For miles away<br>
So safely I lay
