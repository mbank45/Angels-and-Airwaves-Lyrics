"Rebel Girl"<br>
<br>
If you want to dance my love<br>
My little rebel girl<br>
Come a little closer now<br>
And let me in your world<br>
Sometimes it's a lonely cause<br>
So I just make believe<br>
If you're gonna take a chance<br>
Then take a chance on me<br>
<br>
Do you want to go back to where we started<br>
Back before we were broken hearted<br>
Come my way, come-come<br>
I gotta tell ya<br>
The shoe fits<br>
My little Cinderella<br>
<br>
Every little thing you do is like a tidal wave<br>
A fire deep within those eyes<br>
The kill is so cliche<br>
Dance my little Rebel Girl<br>
And show me how you move<br>
Let me take you in my arms<br>
And into the back room<br>
<br>
Do you want to go back to where we started<br>
Back before we were broken hearted<br>
Come my way, come-come<br>
I gotta tell ya<br>
The shoe fits<br>
My little Cinderella<br>
<br>
Do you want to go back to where we started<br>
Back before we were broken hearted<br>
Come my way, come-come<br>
I gotta tell ya<br>
The shoe fits<br>
My little Cinderella<br>
<br>
I'm lost in nerves, I can't recover<br>
I die inside, unlike any other<br>
Come my way, come my little girl<br>
Come back...<br>
<br>
Do you want to go back to where we started<br>
Back before we were broken hearted<br>
Come my way, come-come<br>
I gotta tell ya<br>
The shoe fits<br>
My little Cinderella<br>
<br>
Do you want to go back to where we started<br>
Back before we were broken hearted<br>
Come my way, come-come<br>
I gotta tell ya<br>
The shoe fits<br>
My little Cinderella
