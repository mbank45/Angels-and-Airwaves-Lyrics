"Sirens" <br>
 <br>
There's a weakness in the window <br>
Place my footprints in the dark room <br>
There's lonely voices like a scarecrow <br>
In the hallway like a lost ghost <br>
In the bedroom I see a shadow <br>
From the moon with light from a candle <br>
On a bed-frame lies a girl <br>
Her reflection in the mirror <br>

Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
I like your eyes wide <br>
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
I've been knocking at your backdoor <br>
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
Nervous like a knife fight <br>
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
Be careful what you ask for <br>
 <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
When I can never say the things I mean (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to think of you with me <br>
 <br>
It's a dark night on the West Coast <br>
Then a soft breeze as the sun rose <br>
Then the phone rang like a gunshot <br>
Like a siren on the beach rock <br>
There's a message at the river <br>
A certain package here to the deliver <br>
When the day breaks after nightfall <br>
I will be there, you know I will <br>

Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
I like your eyes wide <br>
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
I've been knocking at your backdoor <br>
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
Nervous like a knife fight <br>
Ladada dadada dadada dadala dada <br>
Be careful what you ask for <br>
 <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
When I can never say the things I mean (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to think of you with me (from time to time) <br>
 <br>
I can hear you breathe, <br>
I'm feeling the shake <br>
And the sound of my heartbeat <br>
Can't let go... <br>
Do you know <br>
I'm feeling the pain <br>
Of my first love? <br>
I won't let it go... <br>
Can't let go <br>

I do this from time to time <br>
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I want to taste you as you breathe (from time to time) <br>
 <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I can never wake from a bad dream (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I can never say the things I mean (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to watch you as you sleep (from time to time) <br>
I do this from time to time <br>
Where I like to think of you with me (from time to time) <br>
