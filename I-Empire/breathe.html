"Breathe" <br>
 <br>
A blue-black shade of love. <br>
Sent from above. <br>
My hands are tied, two worlds alone, <br>
And this I know. <br>
Your breath's like wine, <br>
And just like clouds, my skin crawls. <br>
It's so divine, the sky it glows with fields of light. <br>
 <br>
Did you know that I love you? <br>
Come and lay with me. <br>
I love you. <br>
And on this day, I love you. <br>
You make me feel alive, <br>
And I'll love you <br>
Until the end of time. <br>
 <br>
My hands shake clasped with fear, as you come near <br>
To say goodnight, just like a dove. <br>
A peaceful sign. <br>
To help us by, as you come in, <br>
Let this begin. <br>
Stars fall like dust, our lips will touch, <br>
We speak too much. <br>
 <br>
Did you know that I love you? <br>
Come and lay with me. <br>
I love you. <br>
And on this day, I love you. <br>
You make me feel alive, <br>
And I'll love you <br>
Until the end of time. <br>
 <br>
Did you know that I love you? <br>
Come and lay with me. <br>
I love you. <br>
And on this day, I love you. <br>
You make me feel alive, <br>
And I'll love you <br>
Until the end of time. <br>
 <br>
I've got a lot to say, if you will let me <br>
It's always hard, when you're around me <br>
But here right now, there's interest in your eyes <br>
So hear me out, and hear this the first time <br>
 <br>
That I... love you (come and lay with me) <br>
That I... love you (and on this day) <br>
That I... love you (you make me feel alive) <br>
That I... love you <br>
Till the end of time <br>
