"Love Like Rockets" <br>
 <br>
(Due to the marvels of scientific advance, <br>
My voice is coming to you from a satellite, circling in outer space. <br>
Through this unique means I convey to you and all of mankind <br>
America's wish for Peace on Earth.) <br>
 <br>
I held my head as I left the ground <br>
The belts grew tight as the blast grew loud <br>
A loving wish whispered in my ear <br>
Please leave with grace, all the best my dear <br>
Yeah, it's like <br>
I held your hand as I pulled you in <br>
Your lips sealed tight ready to begin <br>
I kissed you first then you kissed my air <br>
If I ask you once will you ask me every year? <br>
 <br>
Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine) <br>
Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine) <br>
 <br>
The sun is set in the night time sky <br>
The stars they cast a glow upon my eyes <br>
The earth itself a burning ball of light <br>
Yeah, it's like <br>
When our first love was ignited late that night <br>
 <br>
Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine) <br>
Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine) <br>
 <br>
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with thoughts, light and fire and sound <br>
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with thoughts, light and fire and sound <br>
{Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine)} <br>
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with thoughts, light and fire and sound <br>
{Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine)} <br>
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with thoughts, light and fire and sound <br>
{Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine)} <br>
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with thoughts, light and fire and sound <br>
{Do you feel alive? (Imagine, imagine)} <br>
The stars in your eyes light up the sky with thoughts, light and fire and sound <br>
