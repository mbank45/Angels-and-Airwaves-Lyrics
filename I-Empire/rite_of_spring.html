"Rite Of Spring" <br>
 <br>
I was locked all day in the summer heat, <br>
In a small brown house in Suburban Street, <br>
With a skateboard and my shit guitar, <br>
I'd dream all day that they would get me far, <br>
My dad would ask me about my grades, <br>
The asshole sports that I never played. <br>
And then I'd ask about the girls he'd date, <br>
Behind our backs when mom would stay up late. <br>
It was near when I turned sixteen, <br>
Got kicked out of school, and so it seemed <br>
that things were closing in and ready to blow, <br>
My dad moved out about that year or so, <br>
It took an hour to start a punk rock band <br>
To offset my fucked up family land <br>
And as I held my mom would start to cry <br>
I swore ourselves a better life <br>
 <br>
If I had a chance for another try, <br>
I wouldnt change a thing <br>
It's made me all of who I am inside <br>
And if I could thank god <br>
That I am here, and that I am alive <br>
And everyday I wake <br>
I tell myself a little harmless lie <br>
The whole wide world is mine <br>
 <br>
The summers gone, the years have passed, <br>
My friends have changed, a few did last, <br>
The smallest dreams got pushed aside, <br>
The largest ones that changed my life, <br>
And all I wish for has come to pass <br>
From Rock N Roll, to love and cash <br>
It's all success if it's what you need <br>
Do what you like and do it honestly <br>
 <br>
If I had a chance for another try, <br>
I wouldn't change a thing <br>
It's made me all of who I am inside <br>
And if I could thank god <br>
That I am here, and that I am alive <br>
And everyday I wake <br>
I tell myself a little harmless lie <br>
The whole wide world is mine <br>
 <br>
Hey yo oh oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh oh <br>
Hey yo oh oh <br>
 <br>
If I had a chance for another try, <br>
I wouldn't change a thing <br>
It's made me all of who I am inside <br>
And if I could thank god <br>
That I am here, and that I am alive <br>
And everyday I wake <br>
I tell myself a little harmless lie <br>
The whole wide world is mine <br>
