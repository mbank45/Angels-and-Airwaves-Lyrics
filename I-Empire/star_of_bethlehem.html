"Star Of Bethlehem" <br>
 <br>
What are you waiting for? <br>
She's here <br>
She's a star, somewhere in the night time sky <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
The snow has come down on top of everything <br>
The town is alive and well without you <br>
The lights, they peer out of the leafless trees <br>
And you won't be alone, I am beside you <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
Tears spilling out across a dead-end street <br>
Your house is a lonely box that holds you <br>
A star, bright and loud, is in dire need <br>
Of that fear, it is an empty fear inside you <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
True love, the stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die the light will guide you <br>
She's a star <br>
