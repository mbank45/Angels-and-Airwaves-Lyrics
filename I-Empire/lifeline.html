"Lifeline" <br>
 <br>
With an urgent, careful stare, <br>
And some panic in those eyes. <br>
If I see you lying there, <br>
Hoping this was the last time <br>
 <br>
If you hear a distant sound, <br>
And some footsteps by your side. <br>
When the world comes crashing down. <br>
I will find you if you hide. <br>

If you wish it, wish it now. <br>
If you wish it, wish it loud. <br>
If you want it, say it now. <br>
If you want it, say it loud. <br>
 <br>
We all make mistakes. <br>
Here's your Lifeline. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
We all make mistakes. <br>
Here's your Lifeline. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
 <br>
There's a field near the dream. <br>
I watched it grow with whitest light. <br>
I watched us all reach out and lean. <br>
For the strength to touch the sky. <br>
 <br>
If you hear a distant sound. <br>
And some footsteps by your side. <br>
If you feel like coming round. <br>
I will take you for a ride. <br>
 <br>
If you wish it, wish it now. <br>
If you wish it, wish it loud. <br>
If you want it, say it now. <br>
If you want it, say it loud. <br>
 <br>
We all make mistakes. <br>
Here's your Lifeline. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
We all make mistakes. <br>
Here's your Lifeline. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
 <br>
Ooooh.... <br>
 <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
If you want it, I want to. <br>
