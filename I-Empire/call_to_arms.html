"Call To Arms" <br>
 <br>
There's a little black dark scar tire divide <br>
This is it, can you hear me? <br>
Have you ever felt a sad heart buried alive? <br>
You can do almost anything <br>
There's a little red bridge with the view of the sun <br>
With a lake, I recommend such a setting sight <br>
And the thousands of stars, come out thousands of times <br>
We can go, only if you believe. <br>
Only if you believe. <br>
 <br>
Do you feel like you've lost everything you can lose? <br>
This is it, can you hear me? <br>
When you cry do your tears ever chill up the room? <br>
Calling out in a moment of need. <br>
Do you ever lay awake with a look in the eye? <br>
Asking God if a wish is too big to deny <br>
I will offer a line, and it's ready for use. <br>
Let me know are you ready for me? <br>
 <br>
I'd like to say, that you're my only fear <br>
And when I dream, it slowly disappears. <br>
And when I wake, I'm right here by your side... <br>
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time. <br>
 <br>
When the storm brings rain, snow fate of all kinds <br>
You can feel almost anything. <br>
When the day seems to melt, fall flat into night, <br>
You can feel almost anything. <br>
When you can't go on, you got to get up and try. <br>
This is it, can you feel me? <br>
When the bombs come down, you will make it alive, <br>
But only if you want to believe. <br>
 <br>
I'd like to say, that you're my only fear. <br>
And when I dream, it slowly disappears. <br>
And when I wake, I'm right here by your side... <br>
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time. <br>
 <br>
I'd like to say, that you're my only fear. <br>
And when I dream, it slowly disappears. <br>
And when I wake, I'm right here by your side... <br>
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time.
 <br>
Out of time <br>
(You're my only) <br>
When I dream <br>
(You're my only) <br>
When I dream <br>
I feel your heart <br>
When I dream <br>
I'm out of time <br>
(I feel your heart) <br>
When I dream <br>
I'm out of time <br>
(I feel your heart) <br>
 <br>
I feel your heart <br>
I feel your heart <br>
I feel your heart <br>
 <br>
I'd like to say that you're my only fear <br>
And when I dream, it slowly disappears <br>
And when I wake, I'm right here by your side <br>
To feel your heart, beat in and out of time. <br>
