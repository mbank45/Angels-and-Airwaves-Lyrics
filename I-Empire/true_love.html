"True Love" <br>
 <br>
(She's scared...She's a star...Burning across the night time sky) <br>
 <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh [x9] <br>
 <br>
The snow has come down on top of everything <br>
The town is alive and well without you -(She's scared) <br>
The lights they peer out of the leafless trees <br>
And you wont be alone, I am beside you <br>
 <br>
Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh [x4] <br>
 <br>
(True love) <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
The light is the sign that love will guide you home <br>
The stars in the sky illuminate below <br>
If the world were to die, the light would guide you <br>
 <br>
Tears, spilling out, across a dead end street <br>
Your house, is a lonely box that holds you <br>
The star, bright and loud, is in dire need <br>
Of the fear, it is an empty fear inside you <br>

Yo eh, oh eh, oh eh, oh eh [x4] <br>
 <br>
(True love) <br>
