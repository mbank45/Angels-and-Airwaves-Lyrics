"Secret Crowds" <br>
 <br>
(If I had my own world) <br>
(I'd build you an empire) <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd fill it with wealth and desire <br>
A glorious past to admire <br>
And voices of kids out walking dogs, <br>
Birds, planes, cleanest cars <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd love it for all that's inside it <br>
There'd be no more wars, death or riots <br>
There'd be no more police, packed-parking lots, <br>
Guns, bombs sounding off <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd build you an empire <br>
From here to the far lands <br>
To spread love like violence <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd build you an empire <br>
From here to the far lands <br>
To spread love like violence <br>
 <br>
Let me feel you, carry you hig her <br>
Watch our words spread hope like fire <br>
Secret crowds rise up and gather <br>
Hear your voices sing back louder <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd show you the life that's inside it <br>
The way that it glows when you find it <br>
The way it survives with its families, <br>
Friends or its enemies <br>
 <br>
Let's make this a new world <br>
I swear you can go if you want to <br>
I know that you have it within you <br>
Inventing the first clean and usable, <br>
God's greatest miracle <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd build you an empire <br>
From here to the far lands <br>
To spread love like violence <br>
 <br>
If I had my own world <br>
I'd build you an empire <br>
From here to the far lands <br>
To spread love like violence <br>
 <br>
Let me feel you, carry you higher <br>
Watch our words spread hope like fire <br>
Secret crowds rise up and gather <br>
Hear your voices sing back louder <br>
 <br>
Let me feel you, carry you higher <br>
Watch our words spread hope like fire <br>
Secret crowds rise up and gather <br>
Hear your voices sing back louder <br>
 <br>
Let me feel you, carry you higher <br>
Watch our words spread hope like fire <br>
Secret crowds rise up and gather <br>
Hear your voices sing back louder <br>
 <br>
Let me feel you, carry you higher <br>
Watch our words spread hope like fire <br>
Secret crowds rise up and gather <br>
Hear your voices sing back louder <br>
